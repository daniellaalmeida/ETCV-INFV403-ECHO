                <h2>My Experiences</h2>
                <p>This team project has been very useful to put together all the stuff that we have learnt during the course. It has been interesting to work with people from very different fields and without knowing between each other.</p>
                <p>I have been in charge of the Pricing page and of the News page. Thanks to my teammate Darian, I have practiced how to create dialog box and check boxes on the Pricing page. I tried by myself but then I gave up. He motivated me to try it again showing me how to do it. This is a good thing about working with a team, you always learn something new!</p>
                <p>One of the most difficult parts for me has been to work with HTML or CSS files writing by others. Everyone organizes things in very different ways so it is hard to follow the structure of the files and try to add things to them.</p>
